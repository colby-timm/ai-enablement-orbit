# Overview

As part of this Capstone project, I decided to use OpenSpec to design and track my specs.

## Findings

- First Spec (to setup the project) added tasks for follow-up tasks that the agent never did or checked off. These follow-up tasks are really other specs. I had to manually remove and create new specs for them.
- Possible improvement: Have specs create branches or worktrees. Don't do that automatically.
- Ensure you use the slash command `/openspec:apply {spec-name}` directly vs telling the agent to implement with the slash command.
